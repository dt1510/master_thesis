\section{Inductive inference}
Aristotle recognized 2 forms of logical reasoning: a deduction and an induction\cite{sep-aristotle-logic} (3rd form being an abduction recognized later by the philosopher C. S. Peirce(1839-1914)\cite{kimber2012learning}\cite{peirce1935collected}.

A deduction is a sound process of deriving truth from the known facts. Let p be the proposition "All men are mortal." and q be the proposition "Aristotle is a man.". Then we can \emph{deduce} the proposition r "Aristotle is mortal." from p and q.

Given the observations q, r one may \emph{induce} the proposition q as a possible explanation of r from q. However, this process of induction is not sound as in general q, r do not imply p. Indeed, one may induce an explanation p2 "Every being whose name starts with A is mortal." for the observations q, r. But we know that Aphrodite, being a Greek mythology goddess, is not mortal. While  deduced propositions restate the known, an induced proposition provides an explanation for the known and unknown.

The problem of finding a sound explanation for the observations known as a problem of induction has been investigated by Hume\cite{hume1902enquiries}\cite{selby1888treatise}, Popper\cite{keuth2013karl}, Stove\cite{stove1986rationality} and many others.

\section{Inductive logic programming}\cite{muggleton1995inverse}\cite{nienhuys1997foundations}
Inductive logic programming is a subdiscipline of machine learning and logic programming. The goal of inductive logic programming is to study how the theory of inductive inference and logic programming can be used to design theoretical frameworks and programs solving the machine learning problems.

An ILP system is a program that takes as an input a set logical statements $B$ called background knowledge, a set of logical statements $E$ called examples or observations. The output of an ILP system is a set of logical statements $H$ called a hypothesis explaining the observations from the background knowledge. Meaning $E$ can be deduced from $B$ and $H$. The problem of finding $H$ for $B, E$ is called an \emph{ILP task}.

Central issues in ILP are:
\begin{itemize}
\item ILP task definition: what is the machine learning problem sought to be solved and how to define it,
\item completeness by problem classes: how to find a good explanation for every possible pair of $B, E$
\item hypothesis selection: what is a good explanation and how to choose one out of several possibilities,
\item hypothesis search: how to find a good hypothesis efficiently.
\end{itemize}

\section{Classification of inductive logic programming systems}
Many systems and theoretical frameworks have been designed that use the theory of inductive inference to solve an ILP task. It is important to compare these systems and evaluate their level of contribution to solving the issues in ILP in order to identify and understand the most successful aproaches to direct the research in ILP accordingly. To the author's knowledge no extensive comparisons have been made. ILP researchers typically evaluate their new designed system empirically based on the success of solving a carefully chosen ILP task that may not be representative of a general ILP task that can arise.

We aim to compare and classify ILP systems based on how their approach solves the central issues in ILP.
