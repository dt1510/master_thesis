\section{Inductive inference}
Aristotle recognized 2 forms of logical reasoning: a deduction and an induction\cite{sep-aristotle-logic} (3rd form being an abduction recognized later by the philosopher C. S. Peirce(1839-1914)\cite{kimber2012learning}\cite{peirce1935collected}.

A deduction is a sound process of deriving truth from the known facts. Let p be the proposition "All men are mortal." and q be the proposition "Aristotle is a man.". Then we can \emph{deduce} the proposition r "Aristotle is mortal." from p and q.

Given the observations q, r one may \emph{induce} the proposition q as a possible explanation of r from q. However, this process of induction is not sound as in general q, r do not imply p. Indeed, one may induce an explanation p2 "Every being whose name starts with A is mortal." for the observations q, r. But we know that Aphrodite, being a Greek mythology goddess, is not mortal. While  deduced propositions restate the known, an induced proposition provides an explanation for the known and unknown.

The problem of finding a sound explanation for the observations known as a problem of induction has been investigated by Hume\cite{hume1902enquiries}\cite{selby1888treatise}, Popper\cite{keuth2013karl}, Stove\cite{stove1986rationality} and many others.

\section{Inductive logic programming}\cite{muggleton1995inverse}\cite{nienhuys1997foundations}
Inductive logic programming is a subdiscipline of machine learning and logic programming. The goal of inductive logic programming is to study how the theory of inductive inference and logic programming can be used to design theoretical frameworks and programs solving the machine learning problems.

An ILP system is a program that takes as an input a set logical statements $B$ called background knowledge, a set of logical statements $E$ called examples or observations. The output of an ILP system is a set of logical statements $H$ called a hypothesis explaining the observations from the background knowledge. Meaning $E$ can be deduced from $B$ and $H$.

ILP systems have been successfully applied in solving scientific problems with their applications in the areas of mesh design, mutagenicity, river water quality 
\cite{bratko1995applications}. However, the general setting of ILP does not limit their application to these domains, but leaves the space for solving even the hardest problems in the field of machine learning and AI.
\section{Motivation and Objectives}
We explain the value of a classification of ILP systems, summarise the classification conducted in the field of ILP so far and conclude with the objectives of our classication of ILP systems.

\subsection{Value of classification of ILP systems}
The main benefits of the classification of ILP systems are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Identification of the successful methods,
\item Understanding of the differences between various approaches,
\item Formalisation and standarization of common concepts.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Identification of successful methods}
\paragraph{Identification of the successful methods}
When comparing ILP systems for practical applications, we have some measure of success in mind that creates a basis for comparison. In a broader context comparison we are concerned with the structural properties and methods of ILP systems as well.
A comprehensive classification of ILP systems creates the correlation between the measures of success and the defining properties of an ILP system from which we can identify both \emph{established and emerging} techniques that prove to be successful relative to our interests.
\paragraph{Identification of the points for improvement}
Classification of ILP systems not only reveals the strengths of particular techniques, but identifies their weaknesses (and therefore the points of the improvement) evident from the comparison of the systems designed with different objectives.
\subsection{Understanding of differences between various approaches}
As the strengths and weaknesses of ILP systems are correlated with the defining properties induced by their approaches, one gains understanding of the benefits of a particular approach. This often results in removing black-white understanding of the value of ILP systems and aids in making an informed decision in selection of an ILP system for a specific application.

\subsection{Formalisation and standarization of common concepts}
ILP systems are often incompatible as they are developed by numerous researchers with different objectives, but many of their successful techniques are built on the same intuition which makes them in some sense similar. The classification of ILP systems requires that the properties of similar techniques are formalised so that a comparison between these systems could be made. This process of formalisation of the common concepts is natural and arises from what has been proved in practice to be successful as opposed to designing a theoretical framework and then to require ILP systems to be complaint. Because of its naturality, the formalism extending the theory of ILP is appropriate. The newly formalised concepts can be studied theoretically further from which knowledge for designing new ILP systems may arise.

\subsection{Current classification of ILP systems}
There have been numerous comparisons of ILP systems. But mutual comparisons of several systems are very brief as for example a comparison of ILP systems Mis, Cigol, Foil, Golem, Linus, Clint, Mobal, Claudient, Spectre, Progol based on their application \cite{nienhuys1997foundations}.
On the other hand deeper comparisons tend to concern fewer systems: 
a comparison of two ILP systems Progol and Foil on induction of a hypothesis from the large background knowledge \cite{srinivasan1995comparing},
a comparison of Progol, Tilde and C4.5 on road traffic data \cite{roberts1998comparison}. The third kinds of comparisons are between newly created systems with the existing systems \cite{muggleton2012mc} \cite{corapi2011nonmonotonic}.
ILP researchers typically evaluate their new designed system empirically based on the success of finding a hypothesis for a carefully chosen datasets that may not be representative of dataset in the real world.

But to the author's knowledge there has not been an extensive experimental or theoretical comparison of multiple ILP systems (cf. \fullref{ch:evaluation}). 

\subsection{Objectives}
We set the following objectives of classification of ILP systems during the course of the project:
\begin{itemize}
\item classify ILP systems as mathematical objects,
\item identify the successful methods of ILP systems,
\item formalise the intuitive concepts.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Classify ILP systems as mathematical objects}


\subsubsection{Identify the successful methods of ILP systems}

\subsubsection{Formalise the intuitive concepts}

\section{Project development}
In order to classify ILP systems comprehensively, the author first seeked to learn the foundations of ILP from which one could build up a systematic way of comparison of ILP systems as mathematical objects. As the author to his great dissappointment realized that there were no foundations at the theoretical level required, the author decided to pursue his own development of the foundations. During the development, the author discovered that each ILP system solves a different ILP task (as a result of ILP systems not designed on the common foundations) and therefore ILP systems are incomparable on the majority of the properties characterising an ILP system as a mathematical object. Hence the author derived a definition of an ILP task unifying a small class of the properties of an ILP system and retreated to the experimental comparison of ILP systems. The author discoreved that ILP systems do not function as specified by their theoretical frameworks. Hence, in the end, the author pursued a development of the ideas on the theoretical frameworks based on the newest existing literature in hope one would be able to move the classification further at the theoretical level. During this stage the author extended the newest theoretical results and implemented an ILP system encompassing them. The author defined new concepts that were used previously intuitively or at an implementation level only which enabled him to extend the classification of ILP systems to the final state.
