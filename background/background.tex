\subsection{Definitions}

A language of enquiry $\mathcal{L}$ is a model-theoretic language given by constant symbols, relation symbols and function symbols. A language of enquiry $\mathcal{L}$ is a superlanguage of two languages: an observational language $\mathcal{L}_o$ and a hypothesis language $\mathcal{L}_h$.

Every language of enquiry has exactly one $\mathcal{L}$-structure (model) $\mathcal{M}$ that is called the reality of $\mathcal{L}$. The class of all $\mathcal{L}$-structures are called hypothetical models of $\mathcal{L}$.

The set of 
Given a set of $\mathcal{L}$-formulas $\Sigma$, we denote $M(\Sigma)$ to be the class of hypothetical models of $\Sigma$. The set of observations $O$ is the set of the $\mathcal{L}_o$ formulas.
Given a set of observations $O$, we say that any $\mathcal{L}$-formula $Q$ divides the models of $O$ into models of $Q \wedge O$ denoted $M(O \union {Q})$ and the models of $\neg Q \wedge O$ denoted $M(O \union {Q})$.
The background knowledge $B$ is a set of formulas in a hypothesis language $\mathcal{L}_h$.

\subsection{Ultimate problem of scientific discovery}
Statement: Given a language of enquiry $\mathcal{L}$, find the reality $\mathcal{M}$.

We do not consider the situation in which we may desire to learn approximate models of the reality. In general, depending on our language of enquiry, the reality may not exist, however our definition considers only the languages of enquiry with exactly one reality. Some realities, e.g. (regular expression) are learnable, others may be not. The ultimate problem consists of numerous incremental problems.

\subsection{Incremental problem of scientific discovery}
We would like to find the reality most efficiently, where the efficiency may be measured by some criteria - e.g. time and resources. The following simplified definition does not take into the account that some questions may be found more efficiently than others.

Set a probability measure $\mu:M(\emptyset) \to [0,1] \subset \mathcal{R}$ over hypothetical models of a language of enquiry $\mathcal{L}$. Given a background knowledge $B$, find a question $Q$ that minimizes the following equation: $|M(B \union {Q})-M(B \union {\neg Q}|$.

\subsection{Definition of a problem of an induction}
Fix a language of enquiry $\mathcal{L}$ with its sublanguages. Define an equivalence relation over the sets of the
 $\mathcal{L}$-formulas: $\Sigma \sim \Gamma \iff K(\Sigma)=K(\Gamma)$
where $K$ is the Kolmogorov complexity with respect to the description language $\mathcal{L}$. Given observations $O$, find a representative of the axiomatization with the least Kolmogorov complexity of the theory $\Sigma$ whose elementary class of models are precisely the models of $O$.

We call the computable restrictions on the language $L$ to the description language $L_2$ to be a language bias.

Observational bias are the restrictions on the language in which the observations can be made.

A definition concerned with the non-monotonic logics should be adapted.

\subsection{Definition of a scientific method}
A scientific method is an algorithm we use to learn the reality:
1. ask a question to know what observation should be made base on the current induced theory (called the background knowledge).
2. make an observation.
3. induce a more precise theory, start again with 1.
