\section{Introduction}

\section{Definitions}

\begin{defn}
A \emph{language} $\mathcal{L}$ is a model-theoretic language given by:
\begin{enumerate}
\item a set $\mathcal{C}$ of constant symbols,
\item a set $\mathcal{R}$ of relation symbols and a positive integer $n_R$ for each $R \in \mathcal{R}$,
\item a set $\mathcal{F}$ of function symbols and a positive integer $n_f$ for each $f \in \mathcal{F}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
Let a language $\mathcal{L}$ be given by sets $\mathcal{C}$, $\mathcal{R}$, $\mathcal{F}$ and a language $\mathcal{L}'$ given by sets $\mathcal{C}'$, $\mathcal{R}'$, $\mathcal{F}'$.
If $\mathcal{C} \subseteq \mathcal{C}'$, $\mathcal{R} \subseteq \mathcal{R}'$, $\mathcal{F} \subseteq \mathcal{F}'$ we say that $\mathcal{L}$ is a sublanguage of $\mathcal{L}'$, $\mathcal{L}'$ is a superlanguage of $\mathcal{L}$ and denote the relation between the languages by $\mathcal{L} \subseteq \mathcal{L}'$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
Given two languages $\mathcal{L}_o$ called an observational language, $\mathcal{L}_h$ called a hypothesis language, a \emph{language of enquiry} $\mathcal{L}$ is a language satisfying $\mathcal{C}_o $ $\mathcal{L}_o$ and a \emph{hypothesis language} $\mathcal{L}_h$. We call the computable restrictions on the language $\mathcal{L}$ to the hypothesis language $\mathcal{L}_h$ to be a \emph{language bias}.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
Every language of enquiry has exactly one $\mathcal{L}$-structure (model) $\mathcal{M}$ that is called the \emph{reality} of $\mathcal{L}$. The class of all $\mathcal{L}$-structures are called the \emph{hypothetical models} that are models of $\mathcal{L}$.
\end{defn}

\begin{notation}
Given a set of $\mathcal{L}$-formulas $\Sigma$, we denote $M(\Sigma)$ to be the class of hypothetical models of $\Sigma$. The set of observations $O$ is the set of the $\mathcal{L}_o$-formulas.
\end{notation}

\begin{defn}
Given a set of observations $O$, we say that any $\mathcal{L}$-formula $Q$ divides the models of $O$ into models of $Q \wedge O$ denoted $M(O \union {Q})$ and the models of $\neg Q \wedge O$ denoted $M(O \union {Q})$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
The background knowledge (or current induced theory) $B$ is a set of formulas in a hypothesis language $\mathcal{L}_h$.
\end{defn}

\subsection{Ultimate problem of scientific discovery}
Statement: Given a language of enquiry $\mathcal{L}$, find the reality $\mathcal{M}$.

We do not consider the situation in which we may desire to learn approximate models of the reality. In general, depending on our language of enquiry, the reality may not exist, however our definition considers only the languages of enquiry with exactly one reality. Some realities, e.g. (regular expression) are learnable, others may be not. The ultimate problem consists of numerous incremental problems.

\subsection{Incremental problem of scientific discovery}
We would like to find the reality most efficiently, where the efficiency may be measured by some criteria - e.g. time and resources. The following simplified definition does not take into the account that some questions may be found more efficiently than others.

Set a probability measure $\mu:M(\emptyset) \to [0,1] \subset \mathcal{R}$ over hypothetical models of a language of enquiry $\mathcal{L}$. Given a background knowledge $B$, find a question $Q$ that minimizes the following equation: $|M(B \union {Q})-M(B \union {\neg Q})|$, i.e. a question that divides the models of $B$ most evenly.

\subsection{Definition of a problem of an induction}
A problem of induction is a functional problem whose input is a pentuple $P=\langle\mathcal{L}, \mathcal{L}_o, \mathcal{L}_h, O, B\rangle$ where $\mathcal{L}$ is a language of enquiry with its sublanguages $\mathcal{L}_o$, $\mathcal{L}_h$, observations $O$ and the background knowledge $B$.

Define an equivalence relation over the set (called the search space) $H$ of the sets of the $\mathcal{L}$-formulas: $\Sigma \sim \Gamma \iff K(\Sigma)=K(\Gamma)$ where $K$ is the Kolmogorov complexity with respect to the description language $\mathcal{L}$. Find a representative of the axiomatization with the least Kolmogorov complexity of the theory $\Sigma$ whose elementary class of models are precisely the models of $B \union O$. The solution  to a problem of induction (the output) is the representative $\Sigma$ called an induced theory from the background knowledge $B$ and the observations $O$.

\subsection{Definition of a scientific method}
A scientific method is an algorithm used to solve the ultimate problem of the scientific discovery:

0. Start with the emty theory $B_i=\emptyset$, set $i=0$.

1. If $B_i$ has the only model, then terminate, $B_i$ is a complete axiomatization of the reality of the language of enquiry.

2. Solve an incremental problem of scientific discovery by finding a question $Q$ given the current induced theory $B_i$.

3. make an observation - ask an environment oracle a question $Q$.

4. induce a more precise theory $B_{i+1}:=B \union \{Q\}$ if the oracle says that $Q$ is true, $B_{i+1}:=B \union \{\neg Q\}$ if the oracle says that $\neg Q$ is true.

5. Increment $i$ and start from step 1 again.

\subsection{Definition of an ILP problem}
Inductive logic programming problem is a problem of an induction where the language of enquiry $\mathcal{L}$ is the logic programming language (e.g. Prolog), the background knowledge and induced theory are finite.

In the context of ILP one divides the observations into positive examples $E^+$ where the reality is a model of instances of $E^+$, and negative examples $E^-$ - where the reality is a model of negated instances of $E^-$. The division is conceptually important as the clause that is not provable from the axioms is false as opposed to the monotonic logics whose theories can be incomplete.

Note: A constructed $\mathcal{L}$-formula in Prolog is a definite clause. 

\subsection{Definition of an ILP system}
An ILP system is any function $f:\langle\mathcal{L}, \mathcal{L}_o, \mathcal{L}_h, O, B\rangle \mapsto \Sigma \in H$ where the language of enquiry $\mathcal{L}$ is the logic programming language, the background theory $B$ and induced theories of $H$ are finite.

\subsection{Definition of a correct ILP system}
An ILP system is correct if it solves an ILP problem, i.e. its output is a solution to an ILP problem.

\subsection{Examples of ILP systems}
1. $f:\langle\mathcal{L}, \mathcal{L}_o, \mathcal{L}_h, O, B\rangle \to H$, $f:\langle\mathcal{L}, \mathcal{L}_o, \mathcal{L}_h, O, B\rangle \to \emptyset$ is an ILP system, however it is not correct since $M(O \union B) \not= M(\emptyset)$ for all sets of observations and the background knowledge.

2. Progol is an ILP system however it is not correct since it does not always return the induced theory of the least Kolmogorov complexity.

\subsection{Non-determinism, uncertainity, algorithm}

Since the Kolmogorov complexity is uncomputable no computable ILP system is correct. To develop a theory useful in real applications:

1. we need to consider approximations to the Kolmogorov complexity (which are computable) or allow that the induced theory $\Sigma$ is at most $p\%$ more complex from the simpliest induced theory.

2. allow that the induced theory $\Sigma$ found may not have exactly the models that are the models of $B \union O$. We need to think of some acceptable probability error $\epsilon>0$ where $\mu(M(\Sigma))-\mu(M(B \union O)) = \mu(M(\Sigma)  \triangle  M(B \union O)) < \epsilon$.

3. rather than giving a simple function as a black box which we could classify only based on its output from the input, we need a way to inspect the inside of such functions by dividing them into smaller algorithmic parts.
TODO: clarify.
