\section{Inductive Logic Programming problem}

An ILP Problem is as follows: given a set of examples, what is the hypothesis likely to have produced them?

\subsection{ILP: Normal problem setting}
Cheng and Wolf define the ILP problem in the following way:

Given: A finite set of clauses $B$ (background knowledge), and sets of clauses $E+$ and $E-$ (positive and negative examples).
Find: A theory $E$, such that $E \union B$ is correct with respect to $E+$ and $E-$.

\subsection{ILP: The Nonmonotonic problem setting}
From Cheng and Wolf:

Given: Two sets $Z+$ and $Z-$ of Herbrand interpretations (positive and negative examples).
Find: A theory $P$, which is true under each $I E Z+$ and false
under each $I E Z-$.

\subsection{Considtions for constructing an hypothesis}
Necessity: B |= E +
Sufficiency: B ∧ h |= E +
Weak consistency: B ∧ h |= box
Strong consistency: B ∧ h ∧ E − |= box

\subsection\{Definition of a problem of an induction}
Fix a formal system with a language $L$. Given a set of observations $E$ find a theory $\Sigma$ whose models are models of $E$.

\subsection{Problem of scientific discovery}
We would like to learn the model of the world. Set a probability distribution over all models of the domain of discourse. Fix a formal system of enquiry with a language $L$. Given a set of formulas $O$ called observations find a formula $Q$ called a question satisfying certain criteria.
We say that $Q$ divides the models of $O$ into models of $Q \wedge O$ and the models of $\neg Q \wedge O$. Find a question $Q$ such that the probability of the true model be a model of $Q \wedge O \minus$ the probability of the true model be a model of $\neg \wedge O \minus$ is the least possible.

\subsection{Definition of an ILP problem}
Fix a formal system with a language $L$. Given a set of true formulas $E+$ and false formulas $E-$ find a theory $\Sigma$ satisfying $E+$ and consistent with $E-$ whose elementary class of models would be the largest possible.
