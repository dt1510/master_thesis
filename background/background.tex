\section{Inductive Logic Programming problem}

An ILP Problem is as follows: given a set of examples, what is the hypothesis likely to have produced them?

\subsection{ILP: Normal problem setting}
Cheng and Wolf define the ILP problem in the following way:

Given: A finite set of clauses $B$ (background knowledge), and sets of clauses $E+$ and $E-$ (positive and negative examples).
Find: A theory $E$, such that $E \union B$ is correct with respect to $E+$ and $E-$.

\subsection{ILP: The Nonmonotonic problem setting}
From Cheng and Wolf:

Given: Two sets $Z+$ and $Z-$ of Herbrand interpretations (positive and negative examples).
Find: A theory $P$, which is true under each $I E Z+$ and false
under each $I E Z-$.

\subsection{Considtions for constructing an hypothesis}
Necessity: B |= E +
Sufficiency: B ∧ h |= E +
Weak consistency: B ∧ h |= box
Strong consistency: B ∧ h ∧ E − |= box

\subsection{Problem of scientific discovery}
We would like to find the reality as quickly as possible. The following simplified definition does not take into the account the fact that some questions may be found quicker than others.

We would like to learn the model of the world. Set a probability distribution over all models of the domain of discourse. Fix a formal system of enquiry with a language $L$. Given a set of formulas $O$ called observations find a formula $Q$ called a question satisfying certain criteria.
We say that $Q$ divides the models of $O$ into models of $Q \wedge O$ and the models of $\neg Q \wedge O$. Find a question $Q$ such that the probability of the true model be a model of $Q \wedge O \minus$ the probability of the true model be a model of $\neg \wedge O \minus$ is the least possible.

\subsection{Definition of a problem of an induction}
Fix a formal system with a language $L$. Given observations $O$, find the axiomatization with the least Kolmogorov complexity with respect to the description language $L$ of the theory $\Sigma$ whose elementary class of models are precisely the models of $O$.

\subsection{Definition of a scientific method}
A scientific method is an algorithm we use to learn the reality:
1. ask a question to know what observation should be made base on the current induced theory.
2. make an observation.
3. induce a more precise theory, start again with 1.
