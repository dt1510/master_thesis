\chapter{Issues in ILP}\label{chap:issues_in_ilp}
The objective of this chapter is to analyse the central issues in ILP: ILP task definition, completeness by problem classes, hypothesis selection and hypothesis search in order to be able to compare theoretical frameworks and ILP systems in the chapter \nameref{chap:classification_of_ilp_systems} based on how they approach solving a particular issue.

For an analysis of an issue to establish the means for a useful comparison of ILP systems we require:
\begin{itemize}
\item an explanation of the importance of solving an issue,
\item an extraction of the defining properties of an issue in terms of which a corresponding answer is formed.
\end{itemize}
