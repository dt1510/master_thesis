\chapter{Rationale ILP system}
An ILP system Rationale is designed and implemented based on the work by Yamamoto\cite{yamamoto2012inverse} and suggestions in \fullref{chap:advancing_solutions_to_issues_in_ilp}. Rationale solves an extension of an ILP task of explanatory induction for clausal theories $B, E^+, E^-, H$. The objective of this chapter is to reveal the details of the prototype implementation and explain the rationales behind.
