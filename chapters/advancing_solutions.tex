\chapter{Advancing solutions to issues in ILP}\label{chap:advancing_solutions_to_issues_in_ilp}
The objective of this chapter is to provide extensions and future directions for the existing approaches to the issues in ILP by the ILP systems classified. Some of the extensions are used in the implementation of an ILP system Rationale described in \autoref{chap:rationale_ilp_system}.

\section{Inverse Subsumption for Complete Explanatory Induction}\cite{yamamoto2012inverse}
Influenced by the results in \cite{yamamoto2012inverse}, we seek further extensions.
