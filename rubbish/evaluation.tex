\section{Achievements wrt to initial goal}
The author apraises the work achieved by the chapters

The author outlines the turning points of the project timeline which relate the initial goals to what has been achieved and provide a more accurate assement of the final achievements taking into consideration the difficulties faced:

\begin{itemize}
\item classification of ILP systems as mathematical objects,
\item foundations of ILP,
\item retreat to the experimental classification of ILP systems,
\item work on the theory of ILP,
\item extended classification of ILP systems.
\end{itemize}

The author analyses the turning points and evaluates the contributions towards the initial goal.

\subsection{Classification of ILP systems as mathematical objects}
\subsection{Foundations of ILP}
\subsection{Retreat to the experimental classification of ILP systems}
\subsection{Work on the theory of ILP}
\subsection{Extended classification of ILP systems}

The project timeline is presented which is then subsequently used to reflect on the actual achievements relative to initial goals.
