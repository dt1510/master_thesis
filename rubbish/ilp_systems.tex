\subsection{Toplog algorithm}
The Toplog algorithm used to construct the hypothesis uses Mode Directed Inverse Entailment and follows the steps:
\begin{itemize}
\item construct the top theory $\top$,
\item hypothesis derivation: derive refutations of $\neg e$ from $B$ and $\top$, derive a clause $h$ from the refutations, add $h$ to $H$.
\item coverage computation: which examples $E^+$ and $E^-$ are entailed by $h \in H$.
\item hypothesis construction: select $H' \subseteq H$ maximizing the score function - e.g. compression, coverage, accuracy,
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Induction on Failure framework\cite{kimber2012learning}}
Induction on Failure framework (IoF) is a method for deriving a hypothesis $H$ where a single clause $h \in H$ does not necessarily need to explain an example $e \in E$, but an example can be explained by multiple clauses. Such a search space is called a connected theory.
\begin{defn}
A connected theory $T$ for a ground Horn clause $e$ and a Horn theory $B$ is a set of clauses that can be partitioned into sets $T_1, ..., T_n$ so that
(i) $B \union T_1^+ \models e_{head}$,
(ii) $\forall i \in \{1, ..., n-1\}. B \union e_{body} \union T_{i+1}^+ \models T_i^-$,
(iii) $B \union e_{body} \models T_n^-$,
(iv) $B \union T \not\models \square$.
\end{defn}

\subsubsection{Imparo\cite{kimber2012learning}}
Imparo uses the following algorithm to compute the hypothesis $H$:
\begin{itemize}
\item 1: select an example $E$ from the set of positive examples $E_{pos}$,
\item compute the most specific connected theory for an example $E$ and the background knowledge $B$,
\item search the lattice of sets of clauses subsuming the connected theory and choose the hypothesis $H$ with the highest score according to the score function such that $H \models E$,
\item add $H$ to $B$,
\item remove all $E' \in E_{pos}$ implied by new $B$, $B \models E'$.
\item if $E_{pos} = \emptyset$ finish, otherwise go to 1.
\end{itemize}
