The problem of finding $H$ for $B, E$ is called an \emph{ILP task}.

Central issues in ILP are:
\begin{itemize}
\item ILP task definition: what is the machine learning problem sought to be solved and how to define it,
\item completeness by problem classes: how to find a good explanation for every possible pair of $B, E$
\item hypothesis selection: what is a good explanation and how to choose one out of several possibilities,
\item hypothesis search: how to find a good hypothesis efficiently.
\end{itemize}
