\item efficiency: how to find a good explanation efficiently.

\section{Hypothesis search}
The objective of this section is to present the search algorithms for each ILP system and then classify the ILP systems based on the representative properties of a search algorithm.

\subsection{Search direction}
Based on a direction of generalization and specializaton, hypothesis search algorithms of ILP systems fall into two categoies: bottom-up, top-down.

\subsubsection{Bottom-up}
Using the principle of the inverse entailment bottom-up search starts with a construction of the most general hypothesis, called a bottom clause, which is subsequently specialised until a required hypothesis is found.
%$B \and \neg E \models F_1 \models ... \models F_n \models \neg H$
\subsubsection{Top-down}
Top-down algorithms construct a specific top theory $\top$ which is then generalized until a required hypothesis $H$ is found.

$H=\top_n \models ... \models \top_2 \models \top_1=\top$
