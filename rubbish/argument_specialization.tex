\subsection{Argument Specialization}
Argument specialization test assesses the ILP system's ability to learn a hypothesis which require ground terms to be in a head predicate.
\begin{lstlisting}
modeh(learns(+person, +subject)).modeh(learns(#person, +subject)).
%background,male(adam).male(bob).female(alice).female(mary).
%positive examples,learns(polymath, mathematics).learns(polymath, physics).
learns(polymath, chemistry).learns(jack, mathematics).learns(susan, physics).
%negative examples,:- learns(jack, physics).:- learns(susan, chemistry).
\end{lstlisting}
has its target concept
\begin{lstlisting}
learns(polymath,A).
\end{lstlisting}
which has a constant \tc{polymath} as a first argument and a variable as a second argument.
