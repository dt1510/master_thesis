We divide biases used by the ILP systems into categories:
\begin{itemize}
\item Language bias,
\item Preferential bias: a score function,
\item Search control bias: a maximum depth of the proof of examples from background knowledge and a hypothesis.
\end{itemize}

Input elements of an ILP program: background knowledge, examples, mode declarations, determinations, meta statements.
Output elements of an ILP program: hypothesis.
